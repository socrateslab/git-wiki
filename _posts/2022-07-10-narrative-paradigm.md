# Narrative Paradigm

Fisher is convinced that the assumptions of the rational-world paradigm are too limited. He calls for a new conceptual framework (a paradigm shift) in order to better understand human communication. His narrative paradigm is built on five assumptions similar in form to the rational-world paradigm, but quite different in content.12 

- People are essentially storytellers.
- We make decisions on the basis of good reasons, which vary depending on the communication situation, media, and genre (philosophical, technical, rhetorical, or artistic).
- History, biography, culture, and character determine what we consider good reasons.
- Narrative rationality is determined by the coherence and fidelity of our stories.
- The world is a set of stories from which we choose, and thus constantly re-create, our lives.
