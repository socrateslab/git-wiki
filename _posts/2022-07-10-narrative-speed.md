**Why are some narratives more successful?** 

Although this question has ancient roots, studying it empirically has been challenging. We suggest that semantic progression (i.e., semantic similarity between adjoining portions of a narrative) might shape audience responses but that this role changes over the course of a narrative. 

- Specifically, although slower semantic progression (i.e., greater semantic similarity between adjoining portions) is beneficial at the beginning of narratives, 
- faster semantic progression is beneficial toward the end. 

To test this possibility, we used natural language processing and machine learning to analyze over 40,000 movie scripts. 

Consistent with our theorizing, deep-learning-based embeddings find that 
- movies with slower semantic progression early and faster semantic progression later are evaluated more positively. 
- Analysis of over 10,000 TV episodes finds similar results. 

Overall, these findings shed light on what makes narratives engaging, deepen understanding of what drives cultural success, and underscore the value of emerging computational approaches to understand human behavior.
